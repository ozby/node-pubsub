# Execution Roadmap

Current as of: 2026-04-25

Vision and public positioning live in [`docs/research/product/VISION.md`](../research/product/VISION.md);
this file is execution sequencing only. The system-level mermaid view of
what has shipped lives in
[`docs/system-architecture.md`](../system-architecture.md).

## Status

Wave 1 (engineering rigor), Wave 2 (public identity / IngestLens
rebrand), and Wave 3 (integration-platform AI showcase) have all
**shipped**. The repo currently has no in-progress or planned blueprints
— `blueprints/in-progress/` and `blueprints/planned/` are empty.

## Recently shipped (post-wave hardening)

These landed after the last wave closed and aren't tracked as separate
blueprints, but are load-bearing for the current state:

- **JWT jti revocation via KV** (closes tech-debt `h-001`) — commit `f29d83e`.
- **oxlint complexity ≤ 10 enforcement** — hot-path decomposition across
  workers, intake adapter, and lab core; commit `83c3a88`.
- **Pulumi `prd` stack resources + lab UI fonts committed** — commit
  `78990b0`.
- **Catalog migration of `@webpresso/agent-kit` to git+ssh** — commit
  `af1c3b7`; replaces machine-local `file:` paths.
- **`delivery-consumer-correctness` (blueprint)** — three correctness fixes in
  the push-delivery consumer: `msg.attempts` for backoff (B1), 4xx/5xx
  failure classification routing permanents to DLQ (B2), and README +
  `delivery-guarantees.md` reconciliation to match implemented semantics (B4).
  DLQ (`delivery-dlq-{dev,prd}`) provisioned in Pulumi IaC via `ab0eeb1`.
  B3 (notify-before-ack reorder) deferred pending TopicRoom dedupe.

## What's next

There is no committed wave queued. The natural follow-on candidates,
none of which are blueprints yet:

- `manual-replay-after-approval` — surface a re-run button for already-approved
  mapping revisions (deferred from `ai-payload-intake-mapper` v1).
- `additional-demo-lenses` — extend beyond the seeded ATS fixture catalog
  while preserving the public-data boundary.
- `tech-debt-h-002` / `tech-debt-h-003` — remediation steps already
  documented (`907112a`); promote to blueprints when scheduled.

## Key constraints (still binding)

- Use pinned public fixtures by default; optional live public ATS
  fetches must be allowlisted, cached, and disabled by default.
- No paid SaaS dependency and no full connector marketplace.
- Treat `docs/research/product/VISION.md` as the product source of
  truth and `docs/research/2026-04-24-messy-hr-ats-data-demo-sources.md`
  as the messy-data research source.
- Public-package isolation: extracted `@webpresso/*` deps must remain
  installable standalone — no imports from the private `webpresso/monorepo/`.
